The project is cool, actually this is an active research topic.
For getting into it more, you may look at literature around "Neural Architecture Search", proponents of this field, especially using EC for it, are e.g. Risto Mikkullainen.
Be sure to start with something simple indeed, so also with a simple agent (I would assume a simple network, not DQN), you can extend later on.
And yes, the game shall also be quite simple, all of these could work, you may try to obtain some fast running code so that you have more capacity to actually try out parameters.
There are some methods that have been used for optimization algorithms hyperparameter search, notable SMAC2, but this may not be very well suited to neural networks (don't know if somebody ever tried it).
Look out for literature, I myself was involved in SPOT (or SPO, SPOT is the software package) that is model-based in EGO style (EGO is a model based optimization method for expensive problems).
